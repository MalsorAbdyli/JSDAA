Description

The "Job Scheduling" project aims to enhance our scheduling capabilities by implementing a greedy algorithm. This algorithm will optimize the assignment of tasks to available resources, ensuring efficient utilization of resources and timely job completion. The implementation will focus on minimizing overall completion time and improving system performance.

Goals:

Develop and integrate a greedy algorithm for job scheduling.

Optimize resource allocation to minimize job completion time.

Enhance system performance and efficiency in handling scheduled tasks.

Features:

Greedy Algorithm Implementation:

Design and implement a greedy algorithm suitable for job scheduling.

Ensure the algorithm considers factors such as task priority, resource availability, and completion time.

Resource Allocation Optimization:

Develop mechanisms to optimize the allocation of resources based on the characteristics of scheduled jobs.

Implement algorithms to handle resource conflicts and ensure fair distribution.

User Interface Enhancement:

Improve the user interface to provide clear visibility into the scheduling process.

Display real-time updates on job progress, resource utilization, and estimated completion times.

Performance Metrics and Monitoring:

Implement metrics to monitor the performance of the scheduling algorithm.

Integrate logging and monitoring tools to track resource usage, job completion times, and system efficiency.

Scalability and Robustness:

Design the system to handle varying workloads and scale efficiently.

Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms to ensure robustness in the face of unexpected events.

Dependencies:

Identify and document any dependencies on external systems, libraries, or services required for the successful implementation of the greedy algorithm for job scheduling.

Acceptance Criteria:

The implemented greedy algorithm should show improvement in overall job completion time.

The user interface enhancements should provide a user-friendly experience for monitoring and managing scheduled jobs.

The system should handle a range of workloads efficiently without compromising performance.

Definition of Done:

Code implementation completed and reviewed.

Unit tests written and passed.

Integration tests conducted successfully.

Documentation updated to reflect the changes.

User acceptance testing (UAT) performed and approved.
